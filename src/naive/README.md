In a "real world" version of this scenario the folders {v1,v2} would be separate releases for each module as 
specified in the go.mod file.  This could only be demonstrated as changing over time in a single repo.  Different 
SIV versions of the same module are therefore demonstrated by changing the version in the go.mod file and duplicating 
all code to a separate folder.  This is not a realistic scenario, but it is the only way to demonstrate the problem 
in a single repo.
